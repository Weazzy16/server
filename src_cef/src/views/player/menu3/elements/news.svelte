        <div class="title">Casino update</div>
        <div class="desc">Good day, dear readers and players! Just yesterday, July 24, immediately after the news that the Rage Client: MP began to support a new update, which is associated with Diamond Casino, our developers team very quickly added a number of changes and updates to our servers. We will describe in more detail below. On the server, it was added: - The interior of the casino. - The interior of the penthouse. - 33 new tattoos from the new GTA: Online update. The system of playing roulette and bones were transferred inside the casino interior, and no longer changes the playerâ€™s virtual world, which means that you can talk with other players who also play the bones. We will not dwell on this, and over time it will continue to develop these systems. More information about all updates on our servers, and you can observe the latest news in our official Discord server.</div>
